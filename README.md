## Overview

**AeroGlass Window Film™** is a **peel-and-stick upgrade for windows** that saves energy, protects interiors, and **actively cleans the air** when exposed to sunlight.  

Using **photocatalytic nanotechnology (titanium dioxide + graphene)**, the film breaks down **smog, NOx, VOCs, and organic pollutants** in the air while **reducing heating and cooling costs** for homes and offices.

---

## Core Features

- **Heat Control** – Reflects up to **70% of solar heat in summer** and retains indoor heat during winter.  
- **Smog & VOC Breakdown** – **Photocatalytic layer** breaks down harmful pollutants into harmless byproducts when exposed to sunlight.  
- **UV Protection** – Blocks **99% of UV rays**, preserving furnishings and indoor air quality.  
- **Quick Installation** – Peel-and-stick design fits any glass surface.  
- **Long-Lasting** – Each application lasts **5–10 years** before replacement.

---

## How It Works

1. **Solar-Selective Layer** – Reflects infrared radiation while allowing visible light through.  
2. **Photocatalytic Nanocoating (TiO₂ + Graphene)** – Uses sunlight to break down pollutants (NOx, VOCs, and organics).  
3. **Thermal Buffer** – Creates a micro-insulating layer, lowering energy loss.  
4. **Maintenance-Free** – Self-cleaning effect reduces buildup of dust and grime.

## Manufacturing & Scalability

- **Materials**:  
  - Transparent PET or similar polymer film.  
  - TiO₂-graphene composite nanolayer.  
  - Low-VOC adhesive for peel-and-stick application.

- **Production**:  
  - Made using **existing window film production lines**.  
  - Production cost: **$10–$20 per kit (2–4 windows)**.  
  - Retail price: **$40–$100 per kit**.

- **Scalability**:  
  - Distributed via **home improvement stores, online retailers, and office supply chains**.  
  - DAO-supported hubs can produce **low-cost humanitarian versions** for urban air crisis zones.

---

## Use Cases

- **Homes & Apartments** – Reduce energy bills and indoor pollution.  
- **Office Buildings** – Improve employee health and cut operating costs.  
- **Urban High-Rises** – Mitigate smog impact while enhancing building efficiency.  
- **Humanitarian Deployments** – Provide relief in **polluted cities** and **heatwave-prone regions**.

---

## Environmental Impact

- Reduces **HVAC energy use by 20–35%**, cutting carbon emissions.  
- Breaks down **harmful urban pollutants** on a molecular level using only sunlight.  
- Blocks UV damage, extending the life of interior furnishings (reducing waste).  
- Fully recyclable at end of life.
